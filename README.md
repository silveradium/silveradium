# Agra Navaratne

Iâ€™m an Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering undergraduate at the University of Moratuwa, with a passion for fusing embedded systems, AI, and hardware design to build impactful, real-world technologies. I specialize in rapid prototyping of biomedical and assistive devices â€” combining sensors, firmware, and mobile interfaces with a maker's mindset.

When Iâ€™m not soldering circuits or training neural networks, Iâ€™m expressing creativity through visual art and music â€” disciplines that inspire empathy and design thinking in my engineering journey.
