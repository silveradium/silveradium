# Agra Navaratne

Iâ€™m an Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering undergraduate at the University of Moratuwa, with a passion for fusing Robotics, AI, and Biology to build impactful, real-world technologies. My research interests are Robotics, Machine Learning, Biomedical Applications, Digital Signal Processing, Embedded Systems, Analog Circuit Design, Micro-controller Programming.

When Iâ€™m not soldering circuits or training neural networks, Iâ€™m expressing creativity through visual art and music â€” disciplines that inspire empathy and design thinking in my engineering journey.
